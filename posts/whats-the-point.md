title: "What's the point?"

Listening to beautiful music like Interstellar's theme song and thinking about big time scales, space and time - is one of my favorite things to do once every 3-4 months. Doing it now, and this time trying to write my thoughts as I'm thinking.

What's the point? People usually think about their meaning of life and why they matter for this universe. People work hard to impress the boss, get a salary hike, buy that expensive thing, or create an impact on the world.

If you were able to hypothetically erase the existance of a human with their past, no one will notice. If einstein wasn't there, someone else might have invented relativity. Sure, they could have been 1000 years late, but humans are smart. If Elon wasn't building reusable rockets and electric cars, someone else might be (people like Jeff bezos already are).

Similarly, when someone dies, statistically speaking, there's almost no chance someone would remember your name, your face, anything you did after 500 years. There were over 500 million people in 1500's, how many do you really remember from that century?

What's the point anyway? Exploring space? Visiting stars? We, the currently alive people, might not be able to do that in our lifetime. Even if the future generations do it, then what? The big crunch/big freeze is inevitable. The last blackhole will die one day, and so would the hope of all life with it. We could develop all the tech we like, make all the progress in science. But if the age of universe or any super structure we're in is finite and we're bounded in a region we can never escape - we'll lose everything we have done or achieved as a species one day.

If our current understanding is correct, universe can be considered just like a human - but on a very large timescale. Except for the fact all we know is this univese is alone, and it will die one day.

What's the point then? I don't know. There's probably no point. Thinking like this, nothing makes sense - everything from ambitious goals to lazy ass life seems fine. People say live the greatest life so you're proud when you're dying - but that moment too shall pass. Then the person who did a million crimes and a person who was a saint are same. Maybe not in other people's eyes right now, but they'll both be non existent when the universe dies, if not in a few hundered years.

We only pick reasons and things to do because wasting your limited time thinking about that how limited time actually is, for everything, is well, not very helpful for our emotional state. The deeper you go, the more you realize that nothing matters and nothing you do can be truly permanent.

I'm going back to work.
